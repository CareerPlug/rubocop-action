# rubocop-action

This GitHub action runs rubocop and posts offences as inline comments on the pull request. When offences are resolved the comments are fully deleted, making for clean pull requests without leaving a noisy history behind.

This action was created to replace the unmaintained [Hound](https://houndci.com/) service from Thoughtbot.
